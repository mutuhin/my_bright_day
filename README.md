I scraped the website "https://mybrightday.brighthorizons.com/dashboard/login.html" using provided login credentials. The scraping process involved bypassing CAPTCHA verification and handling the full page loading, some of which required manual intervention. Subsequently, I extracted the URLs of all images posted from 2020 to the present. To download these images, I created a script named download.py, which used the extracted URLs and managed cookies to successfully download the images.
